# SpaceCarving
# Project request:
Goal is to implement technique known as “space carving” [1] to reconstruct the shape of
a 3D object from multiple photographs taken at known but arbitrarily distributed viewpoints.
An object is placed on top of a rotating plate together with a custom-designed fiducal marker
(see the following sections for details). The background is made of a uniform-colored
material to be easily distinguished from the target object. A calibrated camera is placed in
front of the object capturing the scene throughout an entire rotation,
